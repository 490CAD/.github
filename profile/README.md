Welcome to the 490CAD at Tongji University. Our team is the branch of [CAD Research Lab at Tongji University](https://github.com/TJ-CADResearchLab/). Our research interests primarily cover 3D computer vision including Nerf, stereo matching, SDF, 3D reconstruction and generation, 3D segmentation, etc.

Our team has three memebrs now: [Nan Wang](https://github.com/BigCiLeng), [Xiaowei Song](https://github.com/KevinSONG729) and [Xiaohan Yan](https://github.com/Micro-han). Our long-term goal is to improve the application of 3D Vision, benefiting society directly by improving people's living environment.
